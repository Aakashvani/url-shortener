# Url Shortener
In the TV show, ‘Silicon Valley’, the character Gavin Belson said “small is the new big” — he wasn’t wrong.

With the endless stream of information we encounter daily, it getting harder to pay attention to anything. URL shorteners such as bit.ly are widely popular because they help to shorten arbitrary URLs like “https://www.google.com/search?q=fasdfsa&sxsrfAOaemvLDZGX" into something a lot shorter like “http://localhost:5000/jeVqPtllJ"

A URL shortener will require two primary API endpoints. The first one will be a POST request to create new short URL. The second one will be a GET request for URL redirecting.
